# Introduction
The objective of this document is to determine what percentage of the stars recorded in the LAMOST (DR2) survey would render Earth uninhabitable if they were to take the place of the sun.

#### Determining Habitability
In this document, the "habitability" of Earth refers to whether the average global temperature of the Earth allows human life to exist, which is contingent on
the energy received by the Sun. Substituting a star with larger mass than the Sun would result in an average global temperature increase in the Earth. For the purposes of this analysis, two sample locations on Earth are taken to represent climatological outliers that will be used to provide an average relative humidity and temperature reading that will serve to represent the relative humidity of the Earth. While this is just one of multiple factors determining true habitability of the Earth (i.e., gravitational disruption which could catastrophically perturb orbit), observing temperature will provide a most accurate proportion if taking only one variable into account. This procedure will assume that orbital radius of the Earth remains fixed.
